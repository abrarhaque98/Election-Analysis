# Election-Audit-Analysis
### Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to develop a script which would perform an election audit analysis for several counties in Colorado. The objective of the script was to identify the total amount of votes cast, the total of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

### Election-Audit Results 

Running the script within VS code on the csv data provided these outcomes for the election audit analysis.

**Total Votes cast**
* 369,711 votes cast amongst all 3 counties for all candidates

**Votes Allocated by County**
* Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
* Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
* Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

**County with Largest Votes**
* Dever

**Candidate vote breakdown**
* Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
* Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
* Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

**Candidate Winner and winner statistics**
* Winner: Diana DeGette
* Winning Vote Count: 272,892

### Election-Audit Summary

In summary the requirements of the script were fulfilled, it was able to identify the total amount of votes cast, the total of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote while displaying the results in an easy viewable manner. It makes it easier to manipulate data of a similar sort in the future for polls of similar structure and removes the need for manually adjusting counts and locations if it were to be done in excel. 

A business proposal to the election commission on how this script could be used would be to apply it to more than local elections.
* Modifications available would be to add districts within states encompassing counties. We could further deep dive into analysis by looking at winners by county to see if they had a lead anywhere.
* As well as adding more voter information for example gender and age of voter, voting party. This would help further analyze the voter data for future references when future candidates run and try to appeal to certain locations, for each category added all you need are a few more variables to adjust for more columns of data.
